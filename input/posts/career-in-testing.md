This is a post I've wanted to write for some time now, but have never felt fully
comfortable writing. I say "might" in the title of this post because lessons
learned vary greatly based on your industry, the types of projects you work on,
and the tools or languages you use in testing. That said, I still wanted to
share my experiences to help better answer the question: "Why testing?"

# Some background

To be clear, as a bright-eyed soon-to-be college grad I had no intention of
starting my career as a software tester. I had grand ambitions of
building...something, but software testing wasn't anywhere on my radar. So of
course that meant, as many unsure college grads do, that I ended up with QA as
my first role. And I was angry. "These people don't respect my ability to code!
They must think I'm awful! Or I must be awful..." was the line of thinking I had
for my first year on the job. I kept these thoughts to myself until my first
yearly review, at which time I laid out my well thought out argument about why I
thought I was being misused and how I needed to be transitioned to a developer
role immediately. I clearly remember the mixed look of confusion and
frustration on my manager's face as I wrapped up my monologue, at which time I
was now expecting to hear all the awful things that I feared my peers and
leaders had been thinking all year. I can't remember his exact words anymore,
but his reply was essentially "You're an idiot/You're not getting it all. We're
not trying to hold you back. We're keeping you in testing *because you’re actually really good at it*!".

Armed we this new knowledge, I sheepishly thanked my boss and went home to
ponder this new information. "Good at software testing? What in the world do I
do now? Am I ever going to become a real software developer?" I could go on for
hours describing the levels of self-doubt I had, but after talking with my
leaders more and getting assurances I was going to still be a "real" software
developer, I let go of the doubt and dived into my career. Still, it was
difficult because none of my peers had experienced being a long-term testers, so
I had no idea if their promises would work out in the long run. That’s why now,
for those who might be 12 years behind me, I’d like to give you an idea of what
you might be able to expect.

# You’ll learn how to write great automated tests

This may seem like the obvious of expectations, but it's also the most critical.
It’s your primary role, right? And doesn’t every developer have to write automated tests anyway?
First off, no, not every developer writes many tests. Most importantly, not all
developers write good automated tests. The funny thing is, it turns out that
writing good tests is hard. Really hard. Anyone can write a few dozen tests
without it turning into a ball of spaghetti, but how about a hundred? How about
a few hundred? Your “just my tests” just became its own application with its own
set of concerns. Logging, configuration management, data access. All of those
"developer concerns" just landed in your lap. You can try to do "just enough" to
get by, but what about the next dozen projects you work on? Do you really want
to write all that code again? Which brings me to...

Good automated tests are:

- as reliable as possible
- as timely as possible
- provide clear feedback

# You'll learn about source control and configuration management

Use Git. Never check-in credentials. Get smart about storing your secrets.

# You’ll become a great library author

You'll become a great library author. Sure, you could get away with just copying
code between projects, but do you really want to? All that config management
stuff? Packagecthat up as a library to us again later. Wrapped some http clients
with logging? New package. Wrote some helpful decorators? New package. And all
of those libraries need the same love and care as any other library, which means
tests (testing your test code? Inconceivable!), CI, docs, packaging, and
good examples.

# You’ll learn CI and infrastructure tools

You’ll learn CI and infrastructure tools. For the first 3-4 years of my career,
I spent the first week of every new project spinning up a new VM, installing and
configuring Visual Studio, Java, and whatever other build tools were necessary.
Then I would stand up and configure CruiseControl.NET or TeamCity. And I always
made the same mistakes. Waste of time. Tools like Jenkins and Docker and
completely redefined how setting up a basic CI works. And guess what? It could
be your job to manage it all. Automate it all away with Docker, Jenkins,
Kubernetes, Ansible, or whatever tools you need. But it could be all on you.
(Oh yeah, and use that all with the libraries you build too. See a pattern here?)

- configuration management

# You might learn a bit about data analytics

You’ll get really good at parsing and outputting files. Wait, where did this one come from?


# You'll learn how to be a better communicator

More than just filing bug reports, you'll learn how to better communicate with
your team. While this is not always the case, sometimes members of the team will
cringe at the site of a tester on approach to their desk. A visit from us either
means "something is broken" or "I don't understand how this feature works".
Either way, it's a disruption to whatever that person was doing at the moment.
While you don't have to try to make those interactions more positive, it
certainly helps to not gleefully skip over to their desk and delight into
telling them all the wonderful ways that you've broken their code. First, if for
no other reasons, it perpetuates the sterotype that testers are simply bug
finders. Do you just find bugs? No. Then represent yourself in a way that
reflects that capability. If you're going to interupt someones workflow, respect
their time and come prepared.

If you're unsure about how a feature works, be prepared to tell that person what
you've tried. "I tried x, y, and z but didn't get the expected behavior" will
always go over than "I don't get it". That's not to say that there won't be
times that you won't need someone to walk you through a feature from step 1, but
try to make those cases the exception and not the rule.

## You'll learn how to file great bug reports

This is hopefully the most obvious item on this list. Other than writing test
automation, it's the most obviously required skill. It's actually a great
skill for anyone involved in the project, from developers to project managers.
Writing clear bug reports not only make it easier for developers to understand
what the potential issue is, but they also help to identify where
misunderstandings may have occurred between the envisioning and implementation
of a feature.

I could (and probably will one day) write an entire blog post about the contents
of a "good" bug reports, but the basic requirements are:

- A title that concisely describes the issue
- A summary that explains both the encountered behavior and the expected behavior

Bonus points for:

- A script or test that reproduces the issue (I would put this under the "must
  haves" but not all things are easily testable)
- Links referencing the expected behavior
- Screenshots or logs of the issue occurring from client-side and (even better)
  server-side

# A higher level perspective of projects

One could argue that developers care about producing code, product managers care
about releasing features, but who on the team is acutely aware of all of these
concerns? As a testers, most likely you!

# Insight Into New Domains

To be clear, you may not always have this experience on a project. Many
applications are simply CRUD applications that don't represent a specific
domain. However, if you are fortunate enough to find yourself working on
projects that require knowledge of a specific domain to test effectively, 

This one is YMMV a bit since it depends on the purpose of the application.
Testing the reservation application for a theme park may give you some insight
into the general operations of a park, but testing a SaaS service that provides
virtual machines like AWS EC2 or Azure Virtual Machines will certainly require
a great deal of domain knowledge to test. This can create a more steep learning
when onboarding, but you'll leave the project far more knowledgable about a
domain than when you started.

# You'll become a better developer

(if you do all the other things)

But wait, didn't I start with saying what you'd learn by becoming a tester? Yes,
but I wanted to make this point clear: any tester working with code *is* a
developer. Not only will you write and manage your own code, but you will also
have the opportunity to observe the way the developers on the team implement
features. I don't like to think of testers as something seperate from
developers. Rather, I'd like to think of testers as a subset of developers.
Every tester has the potential to be an application developer given the right
experience. Inversely, every developer *should* have the same experience and
capabilities as any given tester. Depending on the project I've acted as a
tester, a developer, or both roles. Being a strong tester isn't a weakness: it's
an amazing strength. As I mentioned at the start, not all developers are great
at writing automated tests. Also, not all teams have the advantage/opportunity/choice
of having a dedicated test team. Does that mean automated testing doesn't get
done? Of course not! That work still has to be done, and having a knack for the
testing domain will never hurt your career advancement. Does this mean that all
testers should become developers? Of course not! We all have our own goals in
our careers, and we must find our own paths. Some people will become obsessed
with application quality and become lifetime testers. Others may become
interested in CI pipelines and deployments and follow a DevOps path.

Others, like myself when I started this story, will want to make the transition
in time from testers to developers. And that's just fine. It's not a graduation
as much as it is a transition. You won't be leaving your past behind; you'll be
taking those lessons with you as you turn your focus in another direction. As I
said, not all developers are great testers. You'll have a leg up on some of your
colleagues who think testing "isn't their problem". You'll know how to talk to
your team, especially your testers, as new features come up to be tested.
