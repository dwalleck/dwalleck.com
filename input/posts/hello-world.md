I made my blog. Finally. No really, I've been talking about doing this for the
last decade or so. While I've had some false starts, I haven't been able to
maintain any type of writing velocity and the site falls into obselecence until
I take it down. This time I'm going to try something slightly different with
a form of continious delivery. That's right, I may publish incomplete blog
posts. Now, this does not mean that I'll stop mid-sentence! However, there are
topics that I would like to write on that are fairly complex and time-consuming
to write. Rather than waiting for those specific posts to be "just right", I'd
rather publish them and continously update them as I have time and additional
insights. To respect the time of prospective readers, I'll make sure to tag
any "in flight" posts as drafts and leave it them whether they'd rather read it
now or when it is "done done". I'm not sure how well this experiment will work
for readers, but I hope it helps me work through my analysis paralysis and start
publishing more content! With that said, I hope this content helps provides
useful insights to others and helps influence decisions you make. Thanks for
reading!
